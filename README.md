# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

## About
Hi, I'm Keshav. I have a software development background and I am actively pursuing a career in business intelligence analytics (BIA). I have developed a strong passion for solving real business problems using data analysis and business intelligence. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of BIA as an entry-level BIA developer. 

As I pursued my education, I honed my ability to work with complex datasets and developed a sharp eye for identifying patterns and trends. Through my software development experience, I gained valuable skills in various programming languages (Python, SQL, JS, HTML, CSS), which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as BIA developer. 

This is a repository to showcase my skills in the following topics: SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Excel / Google Sheets
